# Contributing to PondPilot CORS Proxy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PondPilot CORS Proxy!

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a new issue** with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Node version, deployment type)

### Security Issues

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email [security@pondpilot.io](mailto:security@pondpilot.io) with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (optional)

We'll respond within 48 hours.

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- Docker (optional, for testing)
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cors-proxy.git
cd cors-proxy

# Cloudflare Worker
cd cloudflare-worker
npm install
npm run dev

# Self-Hosted
cd ../self-hosted
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üìù Code Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Use const assertions where appropriate
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: Code must pass ESLint (TODO: add config)
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (TODO: add config)
- **Type Safety**: No `any` types without justification
- **Comments**: Explain "why", not "what"

### Security

- **No Logging**: Never log request URLs or content
- **No Storage**: Never store proxied data
- **Validation**: Always validate inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Maintain rate limit protections

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Start the proxy
npm run dev

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test proxy
curl "http://localhost:3000/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173"
```
