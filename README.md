# PondPilot CORS Proxy

A transparent CORS proxy service for PondPilot that enables browser-based access to remote databases and files that don't have CORS headers configured.

## üåü Features

- **Privacy-First**: Transparent proxy with no logging or data retention
- **Multiple Deployment Options**: Official hosted service or self-hosted
- **Security**: Rate limiting, origin validation, and URL filtering
- **Production-Ready**: Built for scale with Cloudflare Workers
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - verify the code yourself

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This repository provides two deployment options:

### 1. Official Hosted Service (Cloudflare Workers)
- Deployed at `cors-proxy.pondpilot.io`
- Free for PondPilot users
- No setup required
- Serverless architecture with global edge network
- **Code:** `./cloudflare-worker/`

### 2. Self-Hosted (Node.js + Docker)
- Full control and privacy
- Easy Docker deployment
- Can be run on any Node.js hosting
- **Code:** `./self-hosted/`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using the Official Service

The official PondPilot CORS proxy is available at:
```
https://cors-proxy.pondpilot.io/proxy?url=<encoded-url>
```

Example:
```bash
curl "https://cors-proxy.pondpilot.io/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fdata.duckdb"
```

### Self-Hosting with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cors-proxy.git
cd cors-proxy/self-hosted

# Configure (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Run with Docker
docker compose up -d
```

Your proxy will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
